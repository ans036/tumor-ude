\begin{abstract}
We present a comprehensive study of Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) for modeling tumor--immune dynamics, implemented using Julia's SciML ecosystem. We developed and compared two UDE architectures in a progressive workflow: \textbf{(A) Dual-network hybrid approach} that initially augments mechanistic Gompertz growth with neural networks to capture unmodeled immune dynamics and temporal corrections, achieving $R^2 = 0.897$, and \textbf{(B) Pure mechanistic UDE approach} that builds upon the hybrid insights to learn interpretable scientific parameters within classical Gompertz and Michaelis--Menten frameworks, achieving superior accuracy ($R^2 = 0.991$) with enhanced parameter interpretability. Both variants enforce biological constraints through physics-informed loss functions and consistency priors. Using cross-validation with validation-based early stopping, we demonstrate robust forecasting capabilities with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.8\% for short-term and 4.3\% for medium-term predictions. Our implementation leverages Julia's differentiable programming capabilities through DifferentialEquations.jl, Flux.jl, and SciMLSensitivity.jl, achieving significant computational efficiency gains. This progressive approach advances the application of Scientific Machine Learning in oncology by providing interpretable, physics-constrained models for tumor--immune interactions with demonstrated forecasting accuracy and clinical translation potential.

\section{Introduction}

The intricate dynamics of tumor--immune interactions represent one of the most challenging problems in computational oncology. Traditional mechanistic models, while interpretable, often underfit due to incomplete understanding of underlying biological mechanisms. Conversely, pure machine learning approaches, despite their flexibility, frequently violate fundamental physical and biological constraints, limiting their clinical applicability \cite{kuznetsov1994,depillis2005validated}.

Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) has emerged as a transformative paradigm that combines the interpretability of mechanistic models with the expressiveness of neural networks \cite{rackauckas2020ude,karniadakis2021physics}. Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), introduced by Rackauckas et al., represent a particularly promising approach that embeds trainable neural components within mechanistic differential equation frameworks, enabling the discovery of missing physics while preserving known scientific principles \cite{raissi2019pinn}.

The modeling of tumor growth has a rich history, with the Gompertz model frequently demonstrating superior predictive performance compared to exponential or logistic alternatives in clinical settings \cite{vaghi2020gompertz}. However, incorporating immune system dynamics substantially complicates the mathematical framework. Classical approaches such as the Kuznetsov--Taylor model and the de Pillis--Radunskaya system introduce multiple effector cell populations and therapy terms, but these models often become parameter-heavy and difficult to calibrate with sparse clinical data \cite{kuznetsov1994,depillis2005validated}.

Julia's SciML ecosystem provides an unprecedented opportunity for implementing sophisticated UDE models through its differentiable programming capabilities \cite{bezanson2017julia,innes2019differentiable}. The ecosystem comprises DifferentialEquations.jl for high-performance ODE solving \cite{rackauckas2017de}, Flux.jl for neural network components \cite{innes2018flux}, SciMLSensitivity.jl for efficient adjoint-based gradient computation, and Optimization.jl for advanced optimization algorithms \cite{rackauckas2019diffeqflux}. This technological foundation enables the development of computationally efficient, scientifically principled models for complex biological systems.

Despite recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning applications to biological systems \cite{shen2023differentiable,aboelyazeed2023differentiable}, there remains a significant gap in applying UDEs specifically to tumor--immune dynamics with rigorous validation and forecasting capabilities. Existing studies have focused primarily on simpler growth models or have not adequately addressed the biological constraints inherent in cancer immunology. Furthermore, most implementations lack the computational efficiency and theoretical rigor necessary for clinical translation, particularly in terms of robust cross-validation and forecasting performance.

Our work addresses these limitations through a progressive research workflow with several key contributions: (i) the development of a dual-network hybrid UDE as an initial exploration that augments mechanistic growth with learned immune dynamics, (ii) the evolution to a pure mechanistic UDE that builds upon hybrid insights while maintaining full parameter interpretability, (iii) implementation of rigorous cross-validation with validation-based early stopping to ensure robust model evaluation, (iv) comprehensive forecasting analysis demonstrating superior predictive accuracy for both short-term and long-term horizons, (v) implementation of biologically consistent constraints and physics-informed priors, and (vi) provision of a fully reproducible Julia implementation with extensive performance metrics.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Universal Differential Equations: Mathematical Foundation}

Universal Differential Equations represent a fundamental advance in Scientific Machine Learning by enabling the seamless integration of mechanistic knowledge with data-driven discovery \cite{lu2021deeponet}. Unlike Neural ODEs, which replace the entire right-hand side of a differential equation with neural networks \cite{chen2018node,dupont2019augmented}, UDEs selectively augment known mechanistic components with trainable neural functions.

Consider a general ODE system of the form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\mathbf{u}}{dt} = f(\mathbf{u}, t, \boldsymbol{\theta})
\label{eq:general_ode}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{u}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents the system state, $t$ is time, and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ are model parameters. In a traditional mechanistic approach, $f$ is completely specified based on physical principles. In contrast, a UDE formulation decomposes $f$ as:

\begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{u}, t, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = f_{\text{known}}(\mathbf{u}, t, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{mech}}) + f_{\text{unknown}}(\mathbf{u}, t, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{nn}})
\label{eq:ude_decomposition}
\end{equation}

where $f_{\text{known}}$ represents well-understood mechanistic components with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{mech}}$, and $f_{\text{unknown}}$ captures unmodeled dynamics through neural networks with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{nn}}$.

The power of UDEs lies in their ability to respect known physics while learning unknown interactions. This is achieved through differentiable programming, where gradients flow through both the neural network components and the ODE solver, enabling end-to-end optimization of the entire system \cite{massaroli2020dissecting,finlay2020train}.

\subsection{Progressive Research Workflow}

Our research follows a progressive methodology where insights from initial explorations inform the development of increasingly sophisticated and interpretable models:

\subsubsection{Phase 1: Dual-Network Hybrid UDE (Initial Exploration)}
The first phase focuses on augmenting known mechanistic growth with neural networks to identify what additional dynamics need to be captured. This approach provides flexibility to learn complex immune interactions while maintaining a mechanistic backbone.

\subsubsection{Phase 2: Pure Mechanistic UDE (Final Approach)}
Building upon insights from the hybrid approach, the second phase develops a fully mechanistic model where neural networks learn context-dependent parameters within classical mathematical frameworks, ensuring complete biological interpretability while achieving superior predictive accuracy.

\subsection{Neural Ordinary Differential Equations Background}

To provide context for our UDE approach, we briefly review Neural ODEs \cite{chen2018node}. A Neural ODE replaces discrete neural network layers with a continuous-time dynamic system:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d\mathbf{h}}{dt} = \text{NN}(\mathbf{h}(t), t, \boldsymbol{\theta})
\label{eq:neural_ode}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{h}(t)$ represents the hidden state evolution and $\text{NN}(\cdot)$ is a neural network. The key insight is that the output layer corresponds to the solution at a specific time: $\mathbf{h}(T) = \text{ODESolve}(\mathbf{h}(0), \text{NN}, 0, T)$.

Training Neural ODEs requires computing gradients with respect to the initial conditions and neural network parameters. This is accomplished through the adjoint sensitivity method, which solves an auxiliary ODE backwards in time to compute gradients efficiently without storing intermediate states \cite{kim2021stiff}.

\subsection{Tumor--Immune UDE Architecture Design}

\subsubsection{Biological Foundation}

Tumor growth in the presence of immune surveillance involves multiple competing processes: intrinsic tumor growth driven by nutrient availability and space constraints, immune-mediated cytotoxic killing, and various regulatory mechanisms that modulate these interactions over time.

The Gompertz growth model provides an excellent mechanistic foundation for tumor dynamics:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dV}{dt} = rV\ln\left(\frac{K}{V}\right)
\label{eq:gompertz}
\end{equation}

where $V(t)$ is tumor volume, $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate, and $K$ is the carrying capacity. This model naturally incorporates growth deceleration as tumors approach their environmental limits.

Immune-mediated tumor killing is commonly modeled using Michaelis--Menten kinetics:
\begin{equation}
\text{Killing Rate} = \frac{c \cdot V \cdot I(t)}{h + V}
\label{eq:michaelis_menten_killing}
\end{equation}

where $I(t)$ represents immune cell concentration, $c$ is the maximum killing rate, and $h$ is the half-saturation constant.

\subsubsection{Phase 1: Dual-Network Hybrid UDE Formulation}

Our initial UDE architecture, the dual-network hybrid approach, augments the mechanistic Gompertz backbone with two specialized neural networks:

\begin{align}
\frac{dV}{dt} &= \underbrace{r_g V \ln\left(\frac{K_g}{V}\right)}_{\text{Gompertz Growth}} - \underbrace{\alpha_g \phi_{\text{IRN}}(V_n, I_n)}_{\text{Learned Immune Pressure}} \nonumber \\
&\quad + \underbrace{\beta w(V_n) \phi_{\text{TACN}}(V_n, t_n)}_{\text{Time-Aware Correction}}
\label{eq:dual_network_ude}
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $r_g, K_g, \alpha_g$ are group-specific mechanistic parameters
    \item $\phi_{\text{IRN}}: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow [0,1]$ is the Immune Response Network with sigmoid activation
    \item $\phi_{\text{TACN}}: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow [-1,1]$ is the Time-Aware Correction Network with tanh activation
    \item $V_n, I_n, t_n$ represent normalized inputs to neural components
    \item $w(V_n)$ is a sigmoid gating function that suppresses corrections at small volumes
    \item $\beta$ is a small scaling factor to prevent correction dominance
\end{itemize}

The IRN captures complex, nonlinear immune response patterns that cannot be adequately described by simple Michaelis--Menten kinetics. The TACN accounts for temporal effects such as immune exhaustion, metabolic changes, or measurement artifacts that evolve over the observation period.

\subsubsection{Phase 2: Pure Mechanistic UDE Formulation (Final Approach)}

Building upon insights from the dual-network hybrid, our final architecture maintains interpretable scientific parameters while allowing them to be context-dependent:

\begin{align}
\frac{dV}{dt} &= \underbrace{r(V,t,I) V \ln\left(\frac{K(V,t,I)}{V}\right)}_{\text{Dynamic Gompertz}} - \underbrace{\frac{c(V,t,I) V I(t)}{h(V,t,I) + V}}_{\text{Dynamic Michaelis--Menten}}
\label{eq:pure_mechanistic_ude}
\end{align}

Here, neural networks learn the parameter mappings:
\begin{align}
(r(V,t,I), K(V,t,I)) &= \text{NN}_{\text{growth}}(V_n, t_n, I_n) \\
(c(V,t,I), h(V,t,I)) &= \text{NN}_{\text{immune}}(V_n, t_n, I_n)
\end{align}

with appropriate activation functions ensuring biological constraints:
\begin{align}
r &\in [r_{\min}, r_{\max}] \quad \text{(growth rate bounds)} \\
K &\geq 1.1V \quad \text{(carrying capacity constraint)} \\
c &\in [c_{\min}, c_{\max}] \quad \text{(killing rate bounds)} \\
h &\in [h_{\min}, h_{\max}] \quad \text{(saturation bounds)}
\end{align}

\subsection{Cross-Validation Strategy and Training Protocol}

\subsubsection{Cross-Validation Design}

To ensure robust model evaluation and forecasting assessment, we implement a sophisticated cross-validation strategy:

\textbf{Training Set Construction:} For each held-out tumor group, we construct training sets that include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For C2 tumors T1--T4: Train on (C3+C4 for same tumor) + (C2 for other tumors)
    \item For C4-T5: Train on C4 (T1--T4) + all C3 groups
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Validation-Based Early Stopping:} Each training run uses the held-out group for validation, implementing early stopping with patience = 200 iterations to prevent overfitting.

\subsubsection{Two-Phase Training Protocol}

Our training strategy employs a robust two-phase optimization approach:

\textbf{Phase 1: AdamW Optimization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning rate: $10^{-3}$ with linear warmup and cosine decay
    \item Maximum iterations: 5,000
    \item Validation-based early stopping with patience = 200
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 2: L-BFGS Refinement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Local convergence refinement starting from best AdamW parameters
    \item Maximum iterations: 500
    \item Ensures numerical precision in parameter estimation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physics-Informed Constraints and Biological Priors}

To ensure biological realism, we implement several constraint mechanisms:

\subsubsection{Parameter Bounds}
Based on biological literature and experimental observations, we enforce:
\begin{align}
r &\in [0.01, 2.0] \text{ day}^{-1} \\
K &\geq 1.1V \text{ (preventing immediate saturation)} \\
c &\in [10^{-3}, 10] \text{ (immune killing rate)} \\
h &\in [10^{-2}, 5] \text{ (half-saturation volume)}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Consistency Prior}
We enforce the biological principle that immune-mediated suppression cannot increase tumor growth:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} = \lambda_{\text{cons}} \sum_{g,j} \max\left(0, \hat{V}^{\text{immune}}_g(t_{g,j}) - \hat{V}^{\text{no-immune}}_g(t_{g,j}) + \varepsilon\right)^2
\label{eq:consistency_prior}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Physics Prior}
A rank-correlation penalty aligns learned immune parameters with observed killing rates:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} = \lambda_{\text{phys}}\left(1 - \rho_{\text{rank}}(I_{\text{static}}, \hat{c}_{\text{kill}})\right)^2
\label{eq:physics_prior}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Training Objective and Optimization Strategy}

The complete loss function combines multiple terms to ensure accurate fitting while maintaining biological plausibility:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} &= \lambda_{\text{vol}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{volume}} + \lambda_{\text{phys}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} + \lambda_{\text{neg}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{negativity}} \nonumber \\
&\quad + \lambda_{\text{cons}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} + \lambda_{\text{reg}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{regularization}}
\label{eq:total_loss}
\end{align}

where:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{volume}} &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{g,j} \left(\hat{V}_g(t_{g,j}) - V_{g,j}\right)^2 \\
\mathcal{L}_{\text{negativity}} &= \sum_{g,j} \mathbf{1}[\hat{V}_g(t_{g,j}) < 0] \hat{V}_g(t_{g,j})^2 \\
\mathcal{L}_{\text{regularization}} &= \|\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{nn}}\|_2^2
\end{align}

\subsection{Forecasting Strategy}

Our forecasting approach generates predictions beyond the observed time horizon using two complementary scenarios:

\subsubsection{Short-term Forecasting}
14-day horizon projections from the last observed time point, providing clinically relevant treatment planning insights.

\subsubsection{Long-term Forecasting}
90-day horizon projections enabling strategic treatment evaluation and resistance pattern identification.

\subsubsection{Comparative Forecasting}
For each forecast horizon, we generate predictions both with immune system active and with immune system suppressed, quantifying the long-term impact of immunotherapeutic interventions.

\subsection{Neural Network Architecture Details}

Both UDE variants employ carefully designed neural architectures optimized for biological data \cite{teshima2020universal}:

\subsubsection{Enhanced Residual Blocks}
We implement custom residual blocks with layer normalization:
\begin{align}
\text{ResBlock}(\mathbf{x}) &= \text{Activation}(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{W}_2 \sigma(\text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{W}_1 \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_1)) + \mathbf{b}_2)
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Network Specifications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immune Response Network (Phase 1)}: 2 inputs $\rightarrow$ 32 hidden $\rightarrow$ 2 ResBlocks $\rightarrow$ 16 hidden $\rightarrow$ 1 output
    \item \textbf{Time-Aware Correction Network (Phase 1)}: 2 inputs $\rightarrow$ 32 hidden $\rightarrow$ 2 ResBlocks $\rightarrow$ 16 hidden $\rightarrow$ 1 output
    \item \textbf{Pure Mechanistic Networks (Phase 2)}: 3 inputs $\rightarrow$ 32 hidden $\rightarrow$ 2 ResBlocks $\rightarrow$ parameter-specific outputs
    \item \textbf{Activation Functions}: SELU for hidden layers, sigmoid for outputs with appropriate scaling
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computational Implementation}

Our implementation leverages Julia's SciML ecosystem for maximum efficiency:

\subsubsection{ODE Solving}
We use Tsit5() with InterpolatingAdjoint() for gradient computation, with strict tolerances (abstol=1e-8, reltol=1e-8) to ensure numerical accuracy.

\subsubsection{Optimization Strategy}
Training employs the two-phase approach described above with multiple random initializations to avoid local minima.

\section{Experimental Setup and Data}

\subsection{Dataset Description}

We utilize longitudinal tumor growth datasets that capture both tumor volume evolution and immune system dynamics. The data consists of two primary components:

\subsubsection{Temporal Dataset}
The main dataset (\texttt{tumor\_time\_to\_event\_data.csv}) contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time-series measurements across multiple tumor scenarios
    \item Immune condition identifiers (C2, C3, C4) representing different immune states
    \item Tumor scenario identifiers (T1-T5) capturing biological variability
    \item Time points (days) and corresponding tumor volumes (mm³)
    \item Concurrent immune cell level measurements
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Static Parameter Dataset}
The parameter sensitivity dataset (\texttt{tumor\_volume\_vs\_Im\_cells\_rate.csv}) provides:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 39 paired measurements of tumor volume and immune killing rates
    \item Strong inverse correlation ($r = -0.82$) validating biological expectations
    \item Ground truth for physics-informed constraints
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

\subsubsection{Normalization Strategy}
Tumor volumes are normalized by a cohort-specific scaling factor (1000 mm³) to improve numerical stability. Immune measurements are similarly scaled to [0,1] range to facilitate neural network training.

\subsubsection{Immune Interpolation}
Given sparse immune measurements, we construct continuous immune functions $I(t)$ using cubic spline interpolation with appropriate boundary conditions. For groups with limited measurements, we employ linear interpolation with extrapolation to maintain continuity.

\subsubsection{Group Formation}
Data is grouped by \{KineticID, TumorID\} combinations, yielding independent trajectories for model training and evaluation. Groups with fewer than 2 time points are excluded to ensure adequate temporal resolution for forecasting evaluation.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Model Performance Progression}

Our progressive research workflow demonstrates clear improvement from the initial hybrid approach to the final pure mechanistic UDE:

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Progressive model development showing improvement from initial hybrid approach to final pure mechanistic UDE. The final approach achieves superior performance while maintaining complete biological interpretability.}
\label{tab:model_comparison}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Phase 1: Dual-Network Hybrid UDE Results}

\subsubsection{Training Convergence}

The dual-network hybrid UDE demonstrates stable convergence during training as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hybrid_training_loss}. The loss function decreases consistently through both AdamW and L-BFGS optimization phases, achieving convergence at $R^2 = 0.897$.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{hybrid_training_loss.png}
\caption{Phase 1: Dual-network hybrid training loss progression showing stable convergence through AdamW and L-BFGS optimization phases.}
\label{fig:hybrid_training_loss}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Learned Neural Network Surfaces}

The Immune Response Network (IRN) successfully captures complex, nonlinear immune dynamics as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:irn_surface}. The learned response surface exhibits several biologically meaningful features: volume-dependent activation where immune response increases with tumor volume, consistent with antigen presentation theories; saturation behavior where response plateaus at high immune fractions, suggesting finite effector capacity; and threshold effects with minimal response at very low immune fractions, reflecting activation thresholds.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{immune_network_surface.png}
\caption{Phase 1: Learned Immune Response Network (IRN) surface showing how immune killing effect varies with normalized tumor volume and immune fraction. The surface captures biologically meaningful patterns including volume-dependent activation and saturation behavior.}
\label{fig:irn_surface}
\end{figure}

The Time-Aware Correction Network (TACN) reveals important temporal patterns not captured by the mechanistic backbone, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tacn_surface}. The network learns early-time corrections (positive corrections during initial growth phases), late-time stabilization (negative corrections at extended time periods), and volume gating (suppressed corrections at small volumes to prevent numerical instabilities).

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{correction_network_surface.png}
\caption{Phase 1: Time-Aware Correction Network (TACN) surface showing temporal adjustments based on normalized tumor volume and time. The surface reveals systematic temporal patterns including early growth corrections and late-time stabilization effects.}
\label{fig:tacn_surface}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Parameter Distribution Analysis}

Analysis of learned parameters across tumor groups reveals meaningful biological stratification as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hybrid_params}. Growth rates span $r \in [0.02, 0.45]$ day$^{-1}$, with clear separation between aggressive and indolent tumor types. Carrying capacity values correlate with final observed volumes, validating biological interpretation. Immune strength parameters distinguish immune-responsive from immune-resistant scenarios.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{hybrid_param_distributions.png}
\caption{Phase 1: Distribution of learned parameters in the dual-network hybrid model across tumor groups, showing biologically meaningful stratification in growth rates, carrying capacities, and immune response strengths.}
\label{fig:hybrid_params}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Phase 2: Pure Mechanistic UDE Results (Final Approach)}

\subsubsection{Training Performance}

The pure mechanistic UDE achieves exceptional training performance with stable convergence as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pure_training_loss}. The model converges to a significantly lower loss than the hybrid approach, reflecting its superior fitting capability while maintaining biological interpretability.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pure_training_loss.png}
\caption{Phase 2: Pure mechanistic UDE training loss showing rapid convergence to exceptionally low loss values, demonstrating superior fitting capability compared to the dual-network hybrid approach.}
\label{fig:pure_training_loss}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Global Model Performance}

The pure mechanistic UDE achieves exceptional performance ($R^2 = 0.991$) while maintaining full parameter interpretability, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:global_fit}. This represents a 10.5\% improvement over the dual-network hybrid and a 29.9\% improvement over the best traditional mechanistic model.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{global_fit.png}
\caption{Phase 2: Global model fit for the pure mechanistic UDE showing exceptional correlation ($R^2 = 0.991$) between predicted and observed tumor volumes across all experimental groups.}
\label{fig:global_fit}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Representative Group Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:group_vol_comparison} shows a representative tumor group (C4|T2) demonstrating the model's ability to capture both immune-mediated suppression and natural growth dynamics. The clear separation between immune-present and immune-absent scenarios validates the biological consistency of our approach.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{group_C4_T2_volume_comparison.png}
\caption{Phase 2: Representative group analysis (C4|T2) showing observed data points, predicted trajectories with immune system active, and counterfactual predictions without immune influence. The gap between trajectories quantifies immune-mediated tumor suppression.}
\label{fig:group_vol_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Component Dynamics Analysis}

Decomposition of growth dynamics reveals the relative contributions of different biological processes as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:components}. The Gompertz contribution dominates early growth phases, gradually decreasing due to saturation effects. Immune killing shows peak activity around days 15-20, followed by gradual decline. The resulting net growth trajectory captures observed volume evolution with high fidelity.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{group_C4_T2_component_dynamics.png}
\caption{Phase 2: Component dynamics analysis for group C4|T2 showing the decomposition of tumor dynamics into Gompertz growth, immune killing, and net growth components. The analysis reveals the temporal evolution of competing biological processes.}
\label{fig:components}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Cross-Validation Performance and Forecasting Results}

\subsubsection{Cross-Validation Metrics Summary}

Our cross-validation approach demonstrates exceptional forecasting performance across all held-out tumor groups:

\subsubsection{Representative Forecasting Case: C4-T5}

Figure~\ref{fig:c4t5_forecast} shows the forecasting performance for the challenging C4-T5 group, demonstrating excellent agreement between predicted and observed volumes throughout the entire time course.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Short-term Forecasting Analysis}

Short-term forecasting (14-day horizon) demonstrates the model's ability to capture immediate tumor dynamics with and without immune suppression, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:c4t5_short_forecast}. The clear divergence between immune-active and immune-suppressed trajectories quantifies the therapeutic benefit of immunological interventions over clinically relevant timescales.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Long-term Forecasting Analysis}

Long-term forecasting (90-day horizon) reveals the extended impact of immune-mediated tumor control, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:c4t5_long_forecast}. The model predicts sustained tumor suppression with active immune system versus unrestricted growth without immune surveillance, providing insights for strategic treatment planning.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Parameter Evolution Analysis}

The temporal evolution of learned biological parameters provides crucial insights into the dynamic nature of tumor--immune interactions. Figure~\ref{fig:param_trajectories} shows the parameter trajectories for a representative cross-validation case (C2-T1), demonstrating how growth rates, carrying capacities, and immune killing parameters adapt over the observation period \cite{dandekar2020machine,lai2021structural}.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{parameter_trajectories_history.png}
\caption{Parameter evolution trajectories for representative case C2-T1, showing temporal dynamics of growth rate r(t), carrying capacity K(t), immune killing rate c\_kill(t), and half-saturation h\_sat(t). The trajectories reveal how biological parameters adapt over time in response to changing tumor--immune dynamics.}
\label{fig:param_trajectories}
\end{figure}

The parameter evolution analysis reveals several key biological insights. The growth rate r(t) shows an initial plateau followed by exponential increase in later stages, consistent with tumor progression patterns observed clinically. The carrying capacity K(t) demonstrates steady increase over time, reflecting expanding nutritional resources and vascular support. The immune killing rate c\_kill(t) remains elevated initially but shows gradual decline, potentially indicating immune exhaustion or tumor immune evasion. The half-saturation parameter h\_sat(t) exhibits complex temporal dynamics, suggesting evolving tumor sensitivity to immune-mediated killing.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Progressive Workflow Benefits}

Our progressive research approach from dual-network hybrid to pure mechanistic UDE demonstrates several key advantages. The initial hybrid exploration revealed the importance of capturing complex immune dynamics beyond simple Michaelis-Menten formulations, while also identifying temporal correction patterns that informed our understanding of the underlying biological processes. Building upon these insights, the pure mechanistic approach achieved superior performance ($R^2 = 0.991$) while maintaining complete biological interpretability, representing the best of both worlds: high accuracy and scientific transparency.

The cross-validation framework with validation-based early stopping ensures robust generalization, as demonstrated by consistent performance across all held-out tumor groups. This approach addresses a critical limitation in many SciML studies where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize to unseen scenarios.

\subsection{Scientific Contributions}

Our work advances the field of Scientific Machine Learning in oncology through several key contributions. The progressive workflow demonstrates how initial exploratory approaches can inform the development of more sophisticated, interpretable models. The rigorous cross-validation framework ensures that reported performance metrics reflect true generalization capability rather than overfitting artifacts.

The forecasting capabilities demonstrated through both short-term (14-day) and long-term (90-day) predictions provide clinically relevant insights for treatment planning. The ability to quantify the difference between immune-active and immune-suppressed scenarios enables direct assessment of immunotherapeutic interventions.

The biological insights gained from our models are particularly noteworthy. The pure mechanistic UDE learns context-dependent parameters within classical mathematical frameworks, revealing how tumor growth rates, carrying capacities, and immune killing parameters vary based on tumor size, time, and immune context. This approach maintains full scientific interpretability while capturing complex nonlinear interactions.

\subsection{Computational Advantages}

The implementation in Julia's SciML ecosystem provides substantial computational benefits. The differentiable programming paradigm enables seamless integration of neural networks with differential equations, while the efficient adjoint methods ensure scalable gradient computation. Our benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in training speed compared to Python implementations, making these approaches practical for clinical deployment.

The validation-based early stopping mechanism prevents overfitting while maintaining computational efficiency. The cross-validation framework, while computationally intensive, provides the robust evaluation necessary for clinical translation.

\subsection{Clinical Translation Potential}

The high predictive accuracy (mean R² = 0.945 across cross-validation folds) and biological interpretability of our pure mechanistic UDE suggest strong potential for clinical translation. The forecasting capabilities demonstrated through MAPE values of 1.8\% (short-term) and 4.3\% (medium-term) approach the accuracy levels required for clinical decision support.

The parameter trajectories learned by the pure mechanistic UDE provide actionable insights for treatment optimization. The consistency constraints ensure that model predictions remain within biologically plausible bounds, enhancing clinical confidence. The ability to generate forecasts both with and without immune system activity enables direct quantification of immunotherapeutic benefits.

However, several challenges must be addressed before clinical deployment. The models require validation on larger, more diverse patient cohorts representing different tumor types, stages, and treatment histories. Real-time data integration capabilities must be developed to enable adaptive treatment protocols. Uncertainty quantification mechanisms are needed to provide confidence intervals on predictions, particularly for long-term forecasts.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Directions}

Our current study has several limitations that suggest directions for future research. The single-compartment tumor volume model, while computationally tractable, neglects spatial heterogeneity and metastatic spread that are crucial in clinical settings. The immune proxy variables, though correlated with outcomes, may not capture the full complexity of immune system dynamics including different effector cell populations and regulatory mechanisms.

The cross-validation framework, while robust within our dataset, needs validation across different experimental systems and clinical cohorts to ensure broader generalizability. The forecasting horizons, while clinically relevant, are limited by the temporal extent of our training data.

Future work should address these limitations through model extensions incorporating spatial modeling through partial differential equations to capture tumor spatial dynamics, multi-scale integration linking molecular, cellular, and tissue-level processes, and stochastic formulations accounting for biological variability and measurement noise.

Clinical integration should focus on real-time adaptation with online learning capabilities for treatment personalization, biomarker integration incorporating genomic and proteomic data, and outcome prediction extending to survival and quality-of-life endpoints. Uncertainty quantification mechanisms are particularly critical for clinical deployment, requiring techniques such as ensemble methods or Bayesian neural networks to provide robust confidence intervals on predictions.
